          <p>a multi-passionate software engineer</p>
          <p>I am a full-stack, front-end leaning software engineer who is passionate about using technology
            to make a positive change in the world. Pivoting from non-profit work, as a youth educator, to this
            new career as an engineer has been thrilling. From problem solving as an educator, to now problem
            solving as an engineer, the medium is different, but the intention is the same. Fixing what's broken
            within systems, while building seamless UIs.
